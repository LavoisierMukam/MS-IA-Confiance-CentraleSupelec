# 🐍 Python Development for Machine Learning

This module covers the fundamentals of Python development applied to Machine Learning, with a focus on computational efficiency and implementation reliability.

## 📂 Lab 1: Strings and NumPy Arrays
**Objective**: Master vectorization to optimize numerical performance.

* **Advanced Slicing**: Manipulation of textual data structures.
* **NumPy Vectorization**: Replacing `for` loops with array operations for massive performance gains.
* **Linear Algebra**: Matrix norms (Frobenius, spectral) and analysis of the Gram matrix $G = M^T M$.
* **Numerical Precision**: Managing floating-point rounding errors using `np.allclose`.
